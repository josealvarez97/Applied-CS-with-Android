# Applied-CS-with-Android
I will facilitate Android-games workshops and this is where I will upload the projects I will develop while preparing for each session.

You may visit the [project Github Webpage](https://josealvarez97.github.io/Applied-CS-with-Android "Applied CS with Android Journalism") I made for documenting and recording the experience - you gotta cherish your memories, don't you? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
