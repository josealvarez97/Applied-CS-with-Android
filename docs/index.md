# So, what is this all about?

Google Education has developed a [lesson plan](https://cswithandroid.withgoogle.com/) available to students leaders at any university who want to spread the hype for computer science at their communities. Here is where my friend [Kate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanha-kate-43a25b141) and I come in.

In november 2017, we started the Computer Science MiCo at our school - the Minerva Schools ACM Student Chapter*. Since then, we've been looking for ways to cherish the passion for computation around our class. The Android development lesson plan developed - and sponsored - by Google will be a great opportunity for doing so!

Stay tuned!

\* *MiCo stands for Minerva Community and ACM for Association for Computing Machinery*
